Contact Management Program

This is a simple contact management system built with Python. It allows users to store and manage contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The program provides the following functionalities:
- Add new contacts
- View all contacts
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete contacts

Contacts are stored persistently in a JSON file, so they remain available between program runs.

Features
- Add a contact: Input name, phone number, and email.
- View contacts: List all contacts with their details.
- Edit contact: Modify the details of an existing contact.
- Delete contact: Remove a contact from the list.
- Persistent storage: Contacts are stored in a `contacts.json` file for future reference.
